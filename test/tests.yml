            The server reply a constant value to every request,
            using a variable declared **inside** the reply function.
            This variable shouldn't be exchanged between fluxions
            as it's declared and used in the same function.

            The server of problem #4 reply a value incremented at every request,
            using a variable declared outside the reply function.
            This variable should be in the scope of the fluxions

            The server of problem #5 uses two different handler for two different request routes.,
            Both handlers modify the same variable, so the fluxions needs to synchronize this value after each modification.
