// # Fluxionnal compiler

// The audienceâ€™s growth a web application needs to adapt to, often leads its development team to quickly adopt disruptive and continuity-threatening shifts of technology.
// To avoid these shifts, we propose an approach that abstracts web applications into an high-level language, which authorizes code mobility to cope with audience dynamic growth and decrease.

// We think a web application can be depicted as a network of small autonomous parts moving from one machine to another and communicating by message streams.
// We named these parts fluxions, by contraction between a stream and a function.
// Fluxions are executed by the [Fluxionnal execution model](../flx-lib).
// Fluxions are distributed over a network of machines according to their interdependencies to minimize overall data transfers.

// **This compiler aims at extracting fluxions and their streams from traditional Javascript code.**
