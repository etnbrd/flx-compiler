# Problem #1

Transform the simplest program into fluxions.

The simplest program is in `src/count1.js`.

It's a server which reply to every request with a fixed value.

Rupture points are characterized by the use of an asynchronous function.

(TODO Asynchronous function, or Higher-order functions ?)

Asynchronous functions are a subset of Higher-order functions.
Based on a list of asynchronous function, the compiler break the program into multiple fluxions along the rupture points.
